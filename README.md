#Serial Monitor Application
This is a Python-based application for monitoring and communicating over UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) connections. The application provides a user-friendly interface for establishing connections, sending and receiving data, and visualizing the received information.

Features
User-Friendly GUI: The application includes an intuitive graphical user interface for easy interaction with UART devices.

Real-time Data Visualization: It allows users to view received data in real-time and even plot it for analysis.

Configurable Settings: Users can specify the port and baud rate for establishing UART connections.

Data Logging: The application supports saving received data for later analysis.

How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have Python installed.

Run the main.py file to launch the application.

In the GUI, enter the desired COM port and baud rate, then click the "Connect" button.

Start sending and receiving data over the UART connection.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
customtkinter (for GUI)
matplotlib (for real-time data plotting)
PySerial (for serial communication)
