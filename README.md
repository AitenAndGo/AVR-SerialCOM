# Serial Monitor Application (Beta version)

This is a Python-based application for monitoring and communicating over UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) connections. The application provides a user-friendly interface for establishing connections, sending and receiving data, and visualizing the received information.

Configurable Settings: Users can specify the port and baud rate for establishing UART connections.

Data Logging: The application supports saving received data for later analysis.

## How to Use
Clone the repository to your local machine.

Ensure you have Python installed.

Run the main.py file to launch the application.

In the GUI, enter the desired COM port and baud rate, then click the "Connect" button.

Start sending and receiving data over the UART connection.
